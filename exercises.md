## Questions

#### What type of writing do you do?

Mainly fiction writing. Specifically short stories.

#### What tools (or techniques) do you use to write?

MS Word for everything prose

Note app on my phone to get ideas down

hardest writing app


#### How do these tools shape the what you write (e.g., constrain the way you write or facilitate your writing)?


I suppose that Word constrains you to writing in a somewhat linear way and makes it difficult to experiment with the layout of your writing. Though it facilitates my writing in that it is very easy to edit and has so far been exactly what I have needed it to be. It's very accessable, portable (in that I can send it across computers/phones), and therefore useful when sending it to a peer for editing  

## Electronic Literature:


### How is electronic literature different from print literature?

Electronic literature differs from print literature as it is literature that uses the digital format in ways that the print format is unable. It is not simply literature created on an electronic platform -  as these days that is almost every form of literature - it must instead use its digital basis to create art that would have been inconveivable one hundred years ago. Where print literature relies on the strength of the prose, digital literature reies on the strength of its code.

### What are some of the qualities of electronic literature?

Interactive, kinetic, aural, motion - these are all qualities of digital literature that are fundamental values of the medium.  What is it doing materially, why is that meaningful? Electronic literature is more often second person. As it is interactive the character is often you. What do YOU do next, opposed to what do THEY or I do next. Infiniteness is another quality of some works, e.g. *Torako Gorge*

### Taroko Gorge(s) [*Taroko Garry*](https://nickm.com/taroko_gorge/taroko_gary/)

### What aspects of the remix are the same?
They are at the same ( or very similar pace). Whilst some of the remixes I have seen go much faster, or much slower, *Tarako Garry* goes at a the same calming, readable pace as *Tarako Gorge*.


### What aspects are different?
The stanzas are different. Whilst *Tarako Gorge* has stanzas of 1, 2, 3 and 4 lines, Leonardo Flores's is made up of stanzas of 1, 3 and 4 lines. Many more combinations as well.

*Tarako Garry* also features a picture depicting the area in which the poem is set. Whilst Tarako Gorge, for those like me who did not know of its existance before experiencing the poem, is left entirely up to the algorithm to generate its depictions.

### Is the remix successful? Why? Why not?

I believe it is successful. Although it is very similar, it is visually more appealing than *Tarako Gorge* and the adition of a picture gives the reader a basis for the poem. It is not too fast or slow like some of the other remixes, and is a soothing work similar to its predecessor. 

### We Walk to You Remix

[We Engage in Violent Acts Against You](https://aquatic-flame-balmoral.glitch.me)

A fun little remix of *We Walk to You* 

### Twinery test run

This piece was my first run at Twinery that includes the addition of a picture. It was fun to figure out how to add pictures to Twine, but I decided that with my final piece it would detract from the atmosphere that I was trying to achieve. I've left the picture in this piece as an example of how I could impliment it in future projects.

# Interactive Fiction or IF

Several works of interactive fiction that I have used as inspiration for my final project.

[Amiral Jota: Lost Pig](https://pr-if.org/play/lostpig/)

[Tiny Tools](https://tinytools.directory/)

[Ditherit](https://ditherit.com/) - A way of making retro images - Possibly useful for Twine if I add images and go for this 'retro' aesthetic.
