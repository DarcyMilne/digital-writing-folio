Project ideas:

-	Noiry detective piece set in a Chicago-esque Melbourne.
-	Piece framed entirely in question form e.g.
    -	Did the player enter the room?
    -	Did the player wonder whether the man was lying?
    -	Did the player think the man was telling the truth?

-	Horror piece that used pictures in twine to ‘spook’ the player.
-	A piece set in one location that slowly changes as the player progresses in the story.


Reflection on the class:

To begin the semester, I don’t think I could have told you what ‘digital writing’ means. I would have maybe thought of Zork, having played that as a kid, and possibly could have pointed you towards something like Disco Elysium, a mostly text based, Lynchian detective game, but would have been unsure if either of these fit the ‘digital writing’ description. I would now define digital fiction as any story – specifically but not exclusively text based – created via digital means. I don’t *think* that I would describe something like Skyrim digital fiction, but something between Skyrim and Zork I would be hard pressed to not group it in with the digital writing space. It can be a fine line between interactive fiction and gaming. Perhaps they are one in the same, but that’s not the case to me.

Early in the class, it was really interesting to read through the many kinds of works of digital fiction and explore how varied the medium is. From Twine, to Bitsy, to text adventures, to computer generated poetry, the different programs/coders all used the digital space in unique and exciting ways. What I think is unique to this digital medium is how in almost all other arts, the result of the finished product is what matters. However, in the digital space this is not necessarily the case, as in many cases the code is mightier than the pen – or the impressiveness of the code is more important than the readability or functionality of the piece as seen from the user’s side. I understood this at the start of the semester, in the same sense that I understand how a difficult kick in footy is impressive to someone that plays football, but is unimpressive to somebody that doesn’t know the basics of the sport. What I mean by this is that when reading/playing/viewing some digital fiction I could understand that a piece was impressive in its creation or execution, but I was not impressed on a more personal level. Though, as the semester went on, and I became more accustomed to the medium and started to create pieces of my own, I quickly begun to see why digital writers and their peers are often more impressed by the technical side of digital writing.

I think that in another life, or in the future, I will learn some kind of coding language as the satisfaction I get from slowly figuring out how to do what kept me engaged with my twine piece in a way that would not have happened if it was a simple piece of fiction. This course certainly heightened my interest in the digital space, and I will be keen to persue this outside of university and get a better idea of not just interactive fiction, but the realm of coding and its artistic capabilities as a whole. 


Reflection on my final piece created on Twinery: *The Bar*

“The goods”:
-	I was very engaged in figuring out all the different things that twine was capable of like:
-	
        -	being able to count items (or drinks in my story)
        -	Opening and closing paths based on what the player has done (e.g. this path won’t open unless the player has done this and that)
        -	Giving the player dialogue options based on what they’ve done and how many drinks they’ve had
        -	Changing the background based on what the player is doing
        -	Using cycling links to make a permanent change on the story (e.g.  is this character a he, she or they?)
     
-	It was fun being able to create a story that didn’t have a defined way to read it, as I’ve only ever created linear works in the past.
-	I liked how simply you could create an atmosphere within a twine piece. Although I didn’t use pictures or sound, I found that changing the background, or colour of the text, was a subtle change that didn’t distract from the story.

“The difficults”:
-	Although I knew this going in, it became a bit overwhelming at times with how much work twine can be to use. It took several minutes/hours of trial and error for each unique implementation of twine code to be effectively used. The ‘Twinery Cookbook’ was difficult to navigate at times, so it was usually easiest to go through the forums looking for help, but even this proved difficult. 
-	My idea of giving the player different dialogue options for each number of “drinks” they had had was really, really time consuming. Not just because I had to write the dialogue, but because I had to code in each dialogue so that it would not show up unless player had x number of drinks. I then had to playtest through all of this dialogue to make sure it didn’t show up at unwanted times, or in an unwanted format.

I’m not much of a planner when I write – I much prefer the write now think later approach. Though, in the case of a twine piece, I can now retrospectively say that planning would have been a huge help to the story. I struggled with writing the conclusion of the piece as I was constantly re-reading it, realising it needed more depth, and then adding more and more branches to the piece. This then elongated the amount of work I had to do at the end of the piece and was a vicious cycle until I decided that enough was enough and I had to put up with a lack of depth if it meant that the story would finish. An example of this was me realising that the $drinks macro didn’t have much of a role in the story besides a few lines of aesthetic dialogue, so I decided to make use of it and added a lot more function behind the macro. This both added to the depth of the story and added to the depth of my insanity as the due date quickly arrived and the piece begun to overwhelm me.

All in all, I’m happy that the piece is completed to a somewhat adequate level, but wished I had the time to fully explore all of the different pathways I had in mind. In the end it was just too much work when heaped on top of my already busy uni/work schedule. To me it lacks the depth that I was aiming for, yet I’m still content with the effort and time I put into it.
