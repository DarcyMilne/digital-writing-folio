Project ideas:

-	Noiry detective piece set in a Chicago-esque Melbourne.
-	Piece framed entirely in question form e.g.


Did the player enter the room?

Did the player wonder whether the man was lying?

Did the player think the man was telling the truth?

-	Horror piece that used pictures in twine to ‘spook’ the player.
-	A piece set in one location that slowly changes as the player progresses in the story.

Reflection on my final piece created on Twinery: *The Bar*

“The goods”:
-	I was very engaged in figuring out all the different things that twine was capable of like:
o	being able to count items (or drinks in my story)
o	Opening and closing paths based on what the player has done (e.g. this path won’t open unless the player has done this and that)
o	Giving the player dialogue options based on what they’ve done and how many drinks they’ve had
o	Changing the background based on what the player is doing
o	Using cycling links to make a permanent change on the story (e.g.  is this character a he, she or they?)
-	It was fun being able to create a story that didn’t have a defined way to read it, as I’ve only ever created linear works in the past.
-	I liked how simply you could create an atmosphere within a twine piece. Although I didn’t use pictures or sound, I found that changing the background, or colour of the text, was a subtle change that didn’t distract from the story.

“The difficults”:
-	Although I knew this going in, it became a bit overwhelming at times with how much work twine can be to use. It took several minutes/hours of trial and error for each unique implementation of twine code to be effectively used. The ‘Twinery Cookbook’ was difficult to navigate at times, so it was usually easiest to go through the forums looking for help, but even this proved difficult. 
-	My idea of giving the player different dialogue options for each number of “drinks” they had had was really, really time consuming. Not just because I had to write the dialogue, but because I had to code in each dialogue so that it would not show up unless player had x number of drinks. I then had to playtest through all of this dialogue to make sure it didn’t show up at unwanted times, or in an unwanted format.
