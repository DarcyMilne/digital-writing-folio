### Questions

#### What type of writing do you do?

Mainly fiction writing. Specifically short stories.

#### What tools (or techniques) do you use to write?

I use MS Word 


#### How do these tools shape the what you write (e.g., constrain the way you write or facilitate your writing)?

I suppose that Word constrains you to writing in a somewhat linear way and makes it difficult to experiment with the layout of your writing. Though it facilitates my writing in that it is very easy to edit and has so far been exactly what I have needed it to be.
